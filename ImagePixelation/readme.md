<h2>What are Image Pixeles</h2>
  <p>
    A pixel(or picture element) is the smallest item of information in an image. Pixels are basically arranged in a 2-dimensional grid that represents using squares. Each pixel is a sample of an original image, where more samples typically provide more-accurate representations of the original. The intensity of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three or four components such as red, green, and blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
